## Team 3a: Developing classification systems to compare diseases to each other
### Team Members: Awtum Brashear, Deborah Cragun, David Enoma, Chang Li, Mirshokhid Okilbekov, Motahareh Pourebehzadi, Sara Stubben 


## Background
-

## Solution
We have developed the webapp "rareform" in order to navigate the relationship between different classification methods and find comparable diseases.

[Access the rareform WebApp](https://share.streamlit.io/awtum/topic3_teama/main/Streamlit_app.py)


## Future Directions
We hope this design can be improved in the following ways: 
1. Comparisons between ICD 11 and ICD 10 
2. Incorporation of genetic information to improve medical coding and grouping
